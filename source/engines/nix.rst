Nix package manager
================================================================================

The Nix package manager is available for handling dependencies of programs.

The most common network application is web applications.
And unfortunately web applications tend to require a lot of finicky dependencies.
Traditionally people would resort to running them in a VM to just avoid the issue.
To encourage more creative and less horrible approaches to solving the problem,
a multi-user installation of the Nix package manager is available on the daemon engines.
This allows unprivileged users to install and use arbitrary packages,
which plausibly permits installing the exact dependencies required for an application.
