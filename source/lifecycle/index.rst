The Lifecycle of Club Servers
==========================================================================

What goes into setting up and tearing down club servers,
both virtual and physical?

Things need:
- A name
- Network
- DNS entries
- Some degree of Clubification (i.e. integration with other services)
- An existence (virtual on engine, virtual on KVM, or physical)

TODO: port all of these here
