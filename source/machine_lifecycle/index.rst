==========================================================================

What goes into setting up and tearing down club servers,

Everything in our room has:
- A name; see :doc:`names`
- Network; see :doc:`network`
- DNS entries; see :doc:`dns`
- An operating system; see :doc:`installer`
- A means of remote access; see :doc:`console`
- Some degree of Clubification, possibly zero; see :doc:`clubify`
- An existence; see :doc:`hosts`
